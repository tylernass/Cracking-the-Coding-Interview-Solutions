# Cracking-the-Coding-Interview-Solutions
In this repository, I have two guides based off of Gayle Laakmann McDowell's "Cracking The Coding Interview". These two guides are to help other software engineers who have interviews and are wondering how to solve rather challenging interview questions.
- SolGuideutions : While I have not yet analyzed the solutions to Cracking the Coding Interview 6E, I have highlighted the techniques, methods, and problem solving tools to tackle these problems.
- Software Interview Essentials: Critical knowledge and topics for the coding interview
